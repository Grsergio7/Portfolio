                <h5>Hello Everyone,</h5>
                <p> After seeing my first "Hello, World" I knew I was hooked. I knew I wanted to create and solve for a living, and this is the best way i can. I am a custom web-designer and developer. Here are a few websites and applications i have made and would like to include more. The doors are open to anyone, from business owners wanting a modern website to companies looking for someone to join the team. I have included my email if you wish to contact me.
                </p>
